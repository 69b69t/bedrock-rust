# bedrockgen
## What is it?
A library crate written in rust to emulate Minecraft's bedrock generation.

As this is a learning project, feel free to submit a PR!
## How do I use it?
You can use it the conventional way, either through cloning and adding as a dependency with a path, or by simply reading it and understanding how it works. I tried to make it fairly simple to understand what is going on; you can even read the raw state values from the random number generators!
## Speed?
I haven't really optimized for speed, as it is mainly for those who wish to use it for learning. It is still pretty fast, and everything is thread safe, so it is easily multithreadable. Though, if you're really going for speed, use CUDA.
## Meow?
Meow!
